ExportPublishTechnical Trading Strategy
A Python-based trading strategy implementation that combines EMA crossovers with ADX and RSI indicators for market analysis and automated signal generation.
Overview
This project implements a comprehensive trading strategy that utilizes technical analysis indicators to identify potential entry and exit points in financial markets. The strategy combines three primary indicators:

Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossovers: To identify trend direction changes
Average Directional Index (ADX): To confirm trend strength
Relative Strength Index (RSI): To identify overbought/oversold conditions

The implementation includes functionality for data acquisition, indicator calculation, signal generation, backtesting, and visualization of results.

adx_period: ADX calculation period (default: 14)
rsi_period: RSI calculation period (default: 14)

Signal Generation

adx_threshold: Minimum ADX value for trend confirmation (default: 25)
rsi_buy: RSI level for buy signals (default: 30)
rsi_sell: RSI level for sell signals (default: 70)

Backtesting

initial_capital: Starting capital for backtesting (default: 10000)

Performance Metrics
The strategy calculates and reports the following performance metrics:

Total Return: Overall percentage gain/loss
Market Return: Buy-and-hold comparison
Annual Return: Annualized performance
Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return
Max Drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline
Number of Trades: Total trading activity
